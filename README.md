# Website
This is a work in progress. I am creating it using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). When it is complete, I will likely add it to my email signature. The current plan is to eventually fill it with my CV, resume, information about me, hobbies and potentially a blog detailing important things I learn throughout the course of my PhD program. As of now, I still trying to understand how the Hugo website developer works. But, when I have created a website I am satisfied with, I will host it through the Github website server. I am excited! 

#Preview

Here is a preview of my current draft:

For now, I am using the [Goa](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-goa/) theme. I like it because it is basic and is all-around practical. All credit for the theme is to [shenyobar](https://github.com/shenoybr) and the theme is available for download at the [Hugo-Goa repository](https://github.com/shenoybr/hugo-goa).
